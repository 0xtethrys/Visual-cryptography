# Visual-cryptography
This Python code implements a visual cryptography algorithm to split an input image into two separate images, A and B, such that neither image alone reveals any meaningful information about the original image. 
The process involves converting the input image to a binary (black and white) format, generating random patterns for each pixel, and distributing these patterns between the two output images to create a cryptographic effect. 
The resulting images can be used to reconstruct the original image only when overlapped.
